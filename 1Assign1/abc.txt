A BufferedInputStream object provides a more efficient way to read just a few bytes at a time from an InputStream. BufferedInputStream object use a buffer to store input from an associated InputStream. In other words, a large number of bytes are read from the underlying stream and stored in an internal buffer. A BufferedInputStream is more efficient than a regular InputStream because reading data from memory is faster than reading it from a disk or a network. All reading is done directly from the internal buffer; the disk or network needs to be accessed only occasionally to fill up the buffer
